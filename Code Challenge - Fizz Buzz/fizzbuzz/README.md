Fizz Buzz
Write a function that outputs the first 100 fizz buzz numbers. Fizz buzz numbers work like
this: if they aren’t divisible by 3 or 5, they are just normal numbers (ex. 4 is 4 in fizz buzz land)
If they are divisible by 3 they get converted to the string ‘fizz’ and if they are divisible by 5
they get converted to ‘buzz’. And, shockingly, if they are divisible by both 3 and 5, they are
converted to the string ‘fizzbuzz’.
How would you change your code so that you could output the first N fizz buzz numbers, return
output in an array, and test your code?
